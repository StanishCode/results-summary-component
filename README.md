## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Incorporating SVGs dynamically within React can be a difficult task. I had to create a component with an array of the SVGs and alter the data to be able to dynamically display them.

### Continued development

Areas that I will need to focus on in future projects include: advanced techniques for responsive grid and flexbox, organization of CSS code, and more effective CSS code.
